 * [r2998] Supported bezier tween. (BetweenAS3.bezier)
 
 * [r2996] Supported parallel and serial by passing Array parameter. (BetweenAS3.parallelTweens, BetweenAS3.serialTweens)
 
 * Changed internal architecture and package.

    Now sequence of tween using related value works fun.
    
     BetweenAS3.serial(
       BetweenAS3.tween(mc, {$x: 100}),
       BetweenAS3.tween(mc, {$x: 100})
     );
    
    Notice: By this change, following two tweens are NOT same.
 
     1. BetweenAS3.tween(mc, {x: 100})
     2. BetweenAS3.tween(mc, {x: 100}, {x: mc.x})
    
    It seems both tweens will tween from current MovieClip position to
    x=10, but tween1 will start from x position on the first time of
    start playing tween and tween2 will start from x position on the
    time of create it. For example, if you set mc.x=10, create the tweens,
    set mc.x=20, and start both tweens, tween1 will be tweened from
    x=20 to x=100 and tween2 will be tweened from x=10 to x=100.
    
    Note: In the old version, both tweens were same as tween2.
    
    It is important to create a round trip tween by using serial and parallel.
    In this case, you have to use a tween created by type2.
    
     t = BetweenAS3.tween(mc, {x: 100}, {x: mc.x});
     BetweenAS3.serial(t, BetweenAS3.reverse(t));
    
    Or a reversed tween will not be tweened correctly.

 * [r2600] Fix: Sometimes ReferenceError has occured while creating a tween.
