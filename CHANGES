BetweenAS3 Change Log
========================================

Alpha r2505 -> HEAD
--------------------

 * [r2617] Changed the timing of calculating tween parameters to the first time of start playing the tween.
 
    Notice: By this change, following two tweens are NOT same.
 
     1. BetweenAS3.tween(mc, {x: 100})
	 2. BetweenAS3.tween(mc, {x: 100}, {x: mc.x})
	
	It seems both tweens will tween from current MovieClip position to
	x=10, but tween1 will start from x position on the first time of
	start playing tween and tween2 will start from x position on the
	time of create it. For example, if you set mc.x=10, create the tweens,
	set mc.x=20, and start both tweens, tween1 will be tweened from
	x=20 to x=100 and tween2 will be tweened from x=10 to x=100.
	
	Note: In the old version, both tweens were same as tween2.
	
	It is important to create a round trip tween by using serial and parallel.
	In this case, you have to use a tween created by type2.
	
	 t = BetweenAS3.tween(mc, {x: 100}, {x: mc.x});
	 BetweenAS3.serial(t, BetweenAS3.reverse(t));
	
	Or a reversed tween will not be tweened correctly.

 * [r2600] Fix: Sometimes ReferenceError has occured while creating a tween.
